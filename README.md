What I Learned in the Workshop:
p5.js Basics:

Learned to set up canvas and interact with elements like createInput(), createButton(), and text().
LocalStorage:

Used localStorage.setItem() and localStorage.getItem() to store and retrieve data persistently.
Event Handling:

Handled user input with mousePressed() for adding and deleting notes.
Useful Notes from the Video:
p5.js Functions:
setup() initializes elements, and draw() updates the display continuously.
Problem Solving:
Issue:
Had trouble displaying the delete buttons for each note.

Solution:
Added createButton() inside the displayNotes() function to ensure unique buttons for each note.

Further Development Ideas:
Add note categories or color codes for better organization.
Implement note editing functionality.
